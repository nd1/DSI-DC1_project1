Data Science Immersive | Project 1	 						

Your project will be assessed using the following standards, [derived from the data science workflow](../../../../resources/syllabus/DSI-workflow-v1.pdf):

- [ ] Identify problem
- [ ] Acquire Data
- [ ] Parse Data
- [ ] Mine Data
- [ ] Refine Data
- [ ] Present Results

Acceptable performance for these standards is based on how well you've performed the specific requirements listed below.

### Performance Evaluation
> Instructors: Mark boxes with 'X' or "n/a" if a section does not apply. Note that "Exceeds Expectations" (3pts) is really only applicable for student writeups or specially marked "*Bonus*" Options.

| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) | Exceeds Expectations (3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Identify: Discuss Data | | |X | |
| Acquire: Load Data with Python | | |X |  |
| Parse: Print Data | | |X |  |
| Mine: Sort Data | | |X | |
| Refine: Analyze Data | | | X| |
| Present: Visualize Data | | | | X|
| *Bonus! Present: Create blog post summary* | | | | |

- Notes:
Nicole, I love that you commented "without pandas" on some of your code. Yes, pandas certainly makes things
easier. Great job on your bonus visualizations. Above and beyond. For this reason, although max point
value is supposed to be 16, you are receiving a 17 out of 16 on Project 1. Really great work.

## Score:
Based on the requirements, you can earn a maximum of  **16**  points on this project. Your score is: **#**

- Remember, your total score is helpful as a gauge of how well you met the project requirements, but use the individual standards and instructor feedback to help iterate and improve on your projects!
